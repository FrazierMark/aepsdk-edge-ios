# Adobe Experience Platform Mobile Extension


## About this project

The Experience Platform Mobile extension allows you to send data to the Adobe Experience Platform from a mobile application. This extension allows you to implement Adobe Experience Cloud capabilities in a more robust way, serve multiple Adobe solutions though one network call, and simultaneously forward this information to the Adobe Experience Platform.

The Adobe Experience Platform Mobile Extension is an extension for the [Adobe Experience Platform SDK](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/acp-sdks).

## Current version
The Experience Platform Mobile extension for iOS is currently in Alpha development.
